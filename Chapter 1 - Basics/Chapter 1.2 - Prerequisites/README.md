# Chapter 1.2 - Prerequisites

Before actually beginning to write your code, make sure you have the following
prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [`steam-user`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-user) (`npm install
	steam-user`)
- [`steam-totp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steam-totp) (`npm install steam-totp`) - module for generating Steam Guard codes  
  - [View Chapter 1.4](../Chapter%201.4%20-%20TOTP#chapter-14) if your bot requires generating Steam Guard codes  

We'll start adding more Node modules (which you install by using NPM) as the
need arises.
