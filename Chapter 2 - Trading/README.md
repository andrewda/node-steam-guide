## Summary

Great! You made it through [Chapter 1](../Chapter%201%20-%20Basics). 
This chapter is where we start to have some fun with Steam. We'll build a bot 
that handles and accepts/declines incoming trade offers. The bot will also 
send a specific user a trade with random items from both parties' inventories.
