# Chapter 4.1 - Prerequisites

We're going to need a couple more things for this chapter than we did for the
previous ones:

- [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [`express-handlebars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
- [`morgan`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan)
- [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
- [`mongoose`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

Also, we'll be needing MongoDB in this chapter, so make sure you have it
installed. There is an installation guide for each operating systems located
[here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorials).

We'll get more into what each module does as the chapter progresses, but just
keep in mind that these all provide useful tools for us when we're creating our
website.
