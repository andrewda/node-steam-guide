# Contributing

When contributing to this guide, please follow these basic rules to ensure that
the chapters stay consistent and easy to follow.

1. Verify you have no spelling issues before creating a Pull Request.
2. If posting code, use three back ticks followed by `js` (\`\`\`js) in order
to properly format your code.
3. Break lines at the end of the last word before reaching 80 characters. Not
81. Not 82. 80.
4. If creating a new chapter, create a directory and title it
`Chapter X - Description`.
	- `X` should be the next chapter number in numerical order.
	- The description should be less than 20 characters.
	- There should be a `README.md` file in root chapter directory with the
	chapter title, summary, and authors. Look at the READMEs of the existing
	chapters to get inspiration.
5. If creating a new sub-chapter, create a directory inside of the chapter and
title it `Chapter X.Y - Description`.
	- `X` should be the chapter number.
	- `Y` should be the next sub-chapter number in numerical order.
	- The content of the sub-chapter should be in a `README.md` file. Checkout the
	existing sub-chapters for inspiration.
	- If applicable, the fully working code should be located in a `project.js`
	file.
