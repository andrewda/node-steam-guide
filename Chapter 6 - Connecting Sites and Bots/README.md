## Summary

This chapter will be a ton of fun â€“ we'll be making an application that can
actually be used in the real world. This application will allow users to
deposit items in order to get credits based on the item's price. These credits
can then be used to purchase other items on the website with a slightly higher
price in order to make profit.
