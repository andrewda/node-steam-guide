## Inspiration

Many people in the [/r/SteamBot](https://reddit.com/r/SteamBot) and
[/r/SteamBotMarket](https://reddit.com/r/SteamBotMarket) communities have been
looking for a complete guide to building Node.js Steam bots, but there really
isn't a complete, up-to-date tutorial online anywhere. This guide is here to
help out anyone and everyone who wants to learn about creating Steam bots.

When I first started creating Steam bots in the early ages about 2 years ago,
it was fairly overwhelming. Trying to piece together different modules in order
to form a functioning bot was a real struggle â€“ but I'm looking help save
new-comers the struggle of learning the new and modern Steam technologies.

Together, we'll learn how to make bots and connect them to websites in this
multi-chapter guide.

## Projects

In this course, you'll be making a number of mini-projects, which will all come
together to create the final website. Eventually we'll end up with a site which
can be used to make profit by selling and buying TF2 or CS:GO skins, similar to
http://cs.money/.
